# questionsgame
A trivia game that uses websockets to handle the game.  
This is my first time using websockets in a personal project and there may be code decisions I made that may not be the best.

Check out my tutorials - [Joe B Programming Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE9Nw2BQlSEM9Cz5ybO1CiQ?view_as=subscriber)

This projects is split into two sections. It is also a work in progres.
There are some things I know I will change in the near future and will try to update the readme files as I do.
## Server Side
 * The server side documentation is pretty much done but some changes may eventually come.
 * [Documentation](https://github.com/joedbenjamin/questionsgame/blob/master/questionsgameserver/readme.md)

## Client Side
 * Still need to write up some documentation on this part.
 * Some of the code still needs to be cleaned up as well... Switching to Material UI but have not finished that part yet.
